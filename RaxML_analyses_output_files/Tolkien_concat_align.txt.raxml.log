[00:00:00] Reading alignment from file: Tolkien_concat_align.txt
[00:00:00] Loaded alignment with 36 taxa and 70 sites

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 68 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: MULTI8_MK
Alignment sites / patterns: 70 / 68
Gaps: 0.00 %
Invariant sites: 0.00 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: Tolkien_concat_align.txt.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (8) for your alignment with 68 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.


ERROR: Too few patterns per thread! RAxML-NG will terminate now to avoid wasting resources.
NOTE:  Please reduce the number of threads (see guidelines above).
NOTE:  This check can be disabled with the '--force' option.
